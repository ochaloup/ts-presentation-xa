= XA transactions in JBoss EAP
Ondra Chaloupka / ochaloup@redhat.com

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 What to check
 * 2PC
 * 3PC
 * Periodic  recovery
 * 2PC optimalizations
 ** presumed rollback optimalization
 ** read-only optimalization
 ** one-phase commit optimalization
 ** LRCO vs. CMR
 * Narayana log store types (filesystem, hornetq, jdbc)
 * Operation with log store and jboss cli
 * JCA multiple datasources in XA
 JCA - Using tracking=true will make it scream... Assuming you are inside a transaction... WildFly doesn't make use of IronJacamar's tracking feature by default. Further details at http://www.ironjacamar.org/doc/roadto12/txtracking.html

== Motivation

[NOTE.speaker]
--
I would like provide you a knowledge about XA transactions and their processing in Narayana.
The aim of this talk is for you understanding how transaction manager processes a transaction
and how it cope with a fail.
--


== Agenda

* Transaction basics
* Transaction API of Java EE


== Basics

// [%step]
* Transactions
* Transactions models
* ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable)
* Resource local vs. Global vs. Distributed

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Short summary from the previous sessions.
https://github.com/ochaloup/ts-presentation/blob/master/slides/
--

== Basics (cont.)

// [%step]
* BMT vs. CMT
* Transaction manager
* JTA vs. JTS

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Transaction manager is Narayana :-o
* JTA is high level API, JTS is low level API
--

== Narayana

image:{images}/logo/narayana-logo.png[]

* Formerly Arjuna Transaction Manager
* Rewritten code from C/C++
* http://narayana.io

== Processes of Narayana in JBoss

* Transaction management
* Transaction reaper
* Periodic recovery

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Transaction management - start transaction, all what we talked in Java EE session
Transaction reaper - background tread which checks timeout of transaction and could force transaction to abort
Periodic recovery - runs in cycles (by default each 2 minutes) and cleaning not-finished transactions

Log from: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGPUSH-1320
Problem of reaper running on background: https://developer.jboss.org/thread/243360
- some other TM does have configuration option to run reaper on foreground (not in background thread)

== Transaction ID

* global transaction ID (UID)

* resource transaction ID (XID)
** format (int)
** global transaction id `byte[]`
** branch qualifier `byte []`

JTA:
* http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/transaction/Transaction.html
* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/transaction/xa/Xid.html
Narayana:
* com.arjuna.ats.jta.transaction.Transaction implements javax.transaction.Transaction - it's context, bound to thread, enlisting resources, has timeout, has synchronizations
* com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.transaction.arjunacore.TransactionImple implements Transaction interface
* com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.transaction.arjunacore.BaseTransaction parent of implementation of UserTransaction and TransactionManager
* BaseTransaction create an TransactionImple which in constructor creates com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.AtomicAction or rather com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.BasicAction
  which in method BasicAction#End(boolean) manages the 2PC
  method #End() then calls all resources which are part of the transaction and calls prepare() + commit()

Configuration (i.e. implemenatation to use - JTA or JTS) is done via MBeans.
This is set in WildFly under transactions (https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/master/transactions)

UID could contain serialized data - e.g. jndi of datasource or serialized connection that could be restored during recovery
UID consists transactionNodeIdentifier (configured in transactions subsystem) to differentiate what TM will take care of recovering the transaction if something wrong happens
  the reason why UID nees node identifier has saved is that XAResource.recover() returns *all* transactions in in-doubt state on the resource - it means *all* transactions which
  are prepared in database - not imporatnt who creates such transaction (some DBs e.g. postgresql have one transaction log for any account and schema - everything is on one pile)
XID consists from UID (global id of txn) + ID of resource (branch qualifier)
branch qualifier is identificator of resource or rather resource manager of the resource - transaction manager is able to join several resources which are part of the transaction
 (belongs to the same UID) under one branch qualifier. It's where XAResource.isSameRM(XAResource) method plays the role. It informs if two resources belongs to one resource manager
 and if so TM could join them under one branch qualifier
