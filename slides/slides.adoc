= XA transactions in JBoss EAP
Ondra Chaloupka / ochaloup@redhat.com

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 What to check/What to talk about
 * 2PC
 * 3PC
 * Periodic  recovery
 * 2PC optimalizations
 ** presumed rollback optimalization
 ** read-only optimalization
 ** one-phase commit optimalization
 ** LRCO vs. CMR
 * Narayana log store types (filesystem, hornetq, jdbc)
 * Operation with log store and jboss cli
 * JCA multiple datasources in XA
 JCA - Using tracking=true will make it scream... Assuming you are inside a transaction... WildFly doesn't make use of IronJacamar's tracking feature by default. Further details at http://www.ironjacamar.org/doc/roadto12/txtracking.html

 * What is XA (and difference to distributed txn in real)
 * What is TM good for
 ** global transaction management
 ** ejb annotation (txn stuff) management
 ** TM works all the time as 2PC manager but has some optimalizations (e.g. one-phase commit)
 * 2PC
 * 3PC
 * Periodic  recovery
 * 2PC optimalizations
 ** presumed rollback optimalization
 ** read-only optimalization
 ** one-phase commit optimalization
 ** LRCO vs. CMR
 * Narayana log store types (filesystem, hornetq, jdbc)
 * Operation with log store and jboss cli
 * JCA multiple datasources in XA
 ** JCA - Using tracking=true will make it scream... Assuming you are inside a transaction... WildFly doesn't make use of IronJacamar's tracking feature by default. Further details at http://www.ironjacamar.org/doc/roadto12/txtracking.html
 ** what is difference to LRCO and one resource as part of global txn
 * XA protocol is not reliable in all possible stages - see the example where it behaves quite strangely - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1181132#c16
 ** the thing that Tom describes in comment 17 is that one resource is commited, other is rollbacked during recovery and arjuna only holds a record about this fact - meaning there is a record in object log store that heuristic rollback happened. In fact this is quite specific for CMR in comments but there is description from IBM where XA is explained: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.admin.doc/ids_admin_1069.htm

[NOTE.speaker]

I would like provide you a knowledge about XA transactions and their processing in Narayana.
The aim of this talk is for you understanding how transaction manager processes a transaction
and how it cope with a fail.
--


== Agenda

* Transaction basics
* Transaction API of Java EE


== Basics

// [%step]
* Transactions
* Transactions models
* ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable)
* Resource local vs. Global vs. Distributed

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Short summary from the previous sessions.
https://github.com/ochaloup/ts-presentation/blob/master/slides/
--

== Basics (cont.)

// [%step]
* BMT vs. CMT
* Transaction manager
* JTA vs. JTS

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Transaction manager is Narayana :-o
* JTA is high level API, JTS is low level API
--

== XA transaction

More resources are part of one global transaction.


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* That's what transaction manager is all about
* Two phase commit tries to solve the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals'_Problem[Two Generals Problem]. There is no full solution to this problem. 2PC is an approximation.
* There are native "distributed" transactions for particular RDBMS: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21109362/how-to-process-distributed-transaction-within-postgresql (native distributed transactions)

== 2 phase commit

```
transactionalOperation() is a procedure at some client site
begin() is a remote invocation to the coordinator
    create global XID
    return global XID
XID is added to the thread-local context at the caller
executeOperation(params) is a remote invocation to a participant site
    XID is implicitly propagated to the server side thread
    inform coordinator that this site is a participant
    execute the operation! (acquiring locks)
... more operations ....
commit() is a remote invocation to the coordinator
    XID is implicitly propagated to the server side thread
    -------------- 2PC starts here ----------------
    for all registered participants:
        prepare(XID) is a remote invocation to each site
            make sure that the transaction can be committed,
            usually by writing and flushing a log 
            return OK
    gather decisions
    for all reguistered participants:
        commit(XID) is a remote invocation to each site
            log transaction commit
            (release locks)
    -------------- 2PC ends here ----------------
XID is removed from the thread-local context at the caller
transaction is complete!
```

* Formerly Arjuna Transaction Manager
* Rewritten code from C/C++

== Processes of Narayana in JBoss

* Transaction management
* Transaction reaper
* Periodic recovery

[NOTE.speaker]

Transaction management - start transaction, all what we talked in Java EE session
Transaction reaper - background tread which checks timeout of transaction and could force transaction to abort
Periodic recovery - runs in cycles (by default each 2 minutes) and cleaning not-finished transactions

== Transaction ID

* global transaction ID (UID)

* resource transaction ID (XID)
** format (int)
** global transaction id `byte[]`
** branch qualifier `byte []`

JTA:
* http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/transaction/Transaction.html
* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/transaction/xa/Xid.html
Narayana:
* com.arjuna.ats.jta.transaction.Transaction implements javax.transaction.Transaction - it's context, bound to thread, enlisting resources, has timeout, has synchronizations
* com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.transaction.arjunacore.TransactionImple implements Transaction interface
* com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.transaction.arjunacore.BaseTransaction parent of implementation of UserTransaction and TransactionManager
* BaseTransaction create an TransactionImple which in constructor creates com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.AtomicAction or rather com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.BasicAction
  which in method BasicAction#End(boolean) manages the 2PC
  method #End() then calls all resources which are part of the transaction and calls prepare() + commit()

Configuration (i.e. implemenatation to use - JTA or JTS) is done via MBeans.
This is set in WildFly under transactions (https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/master/transactions)

UID could contain serialized data - e.g. jndi of datasource or serialized connection that could be restored during recovery
UID consists transactionNodeIdentifier (configured in transactions subsystem) to differentiate what TM will take care of recovering the transaction if something wrong happens
  the reason why UID nees node identifier has saved is that XAResource.recover() returns *all* transactions in in-doubt state on the resource - it means *all* transactions which
  are prepared in database - not imporatnt who creates such transaction (some DBs e.g. postgresql have one transaction log for any account and schema - everything is on one pile)
XID consists from UID (global id of txn) + ID of resource (branch qualifier)
branch qualifier is identificator of resource or rather resource manager of the resource - transaction manager is able to join several resources which are part of the transaction
 (belongs to the same UID) under one branch qualifier. It's where XAResource.isSameRM(XAResource) method plays the role. It informs if two resources belongs to one resource manager
 and if so TM could join them under one branch qualifier
